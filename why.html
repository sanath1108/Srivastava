      "2 ghante marake kyu hi jau i'll better sleep" soch rha tha mein uss din.
      but i thought colleague hai and bulaya hai toh i should go. and also i was
      looking forward to meet this 'F1 girl Riya' about who Jacinta had
      mentioned once. i was like kuch toh interesting baat kr paunga aaj warna
      wahi sade hue log. traffic tackle kr ke thak kr i reached the 1st floor of
      that PG jiska naam bilkul yaad nhi hai mujhe and entered Stephen's room
      and the moment i kept my helmet on the table which was on the right side
      of the door (w.r.t. one entering the room),i saw her. my pretty to-be
      girlfriend sitting on a chair in a very sophesticated manner jab ke baaki
      chutye stephen ke bed pe baithe the. black top and blue jeans and
      definitely some costly handbag. to pass the time Jacinta started
      'truth/dare' game and i remember very partially that Srivastava ko question aaya
      tha like "wild makeout" or "makeout in pub" aisa kuch and she denied it in
      such a way ke she had done it and i was like wild hai boss yeh ladki. cab
      mein on the way to the dinner, thanks to the driver we got to sit together
      and I STARTED the convo. the only girl i had met who had seen all the
      shows and movies that i have. in fact mujhse zyada. and ofc F1. i think
      that was the most interesting conversation i have had after joining the
      company. and idk how, but i got no-filter with her in a few moments. MG
      road pe raat ko chalne wali dhando ke baare mein baat kr rhe hai, mere
      tinder bumble ke baare mein. she showed a reel from her account jo abhi
      chennai gyi toh banaya tha usne. how she liked ferrari was catchy for
      me😂.there was this other colleague named Anoohya jisne mujhe uss din
      dinner pe bola ke "badi baatein kr rhe the Riya ke saath. hum logo se toh
      first time itni baatein nhi hui thi tumhari" and i was like some
      connection maybe 😗. the most memorable thing of that evening was
      Srivastava bullying Harshit on the dinner table. damnnn! idk how
      Srivastava felt about it but i certainly felt something that day. and then
      a day later it was me who texted her on whatsapp and tried to build up a
      conversation.
      <br />And kids that's how i met ur mother" <br />
      <br />And this is how i am gonna start my story when you go out for
      groceries and i am with the kids Srivastava. Kaafi achhi tarah se likhi
      hai yaar meine. Writer toh ban sakta hu na bro. Book ka naam will be 2
      States Dobara😂😂.
      <br> You might pause the song now <a href="#audioPlayer">Go Up</a>

    <p>
      My year started with a good trip followed by internship and ofc PATHAN
      released on 26th of January. SRK on silver screen after 5 fucking years.
      Got to know about u somewhere mid March. I spoke a line to u "u don't need
      to answer that" somewhere mid march again. Tumhe achhe se dekh paaya 31st
      March ko and MEINE baatein and chat dono shuru ki Srivastava. No doubts
      there.

    <br />And then a new,beautifu,awesome, best and all those adjectives wala
    chapter start ho gyi meri life ki (ik filmy sound krta hai but hu baby mein
    filmy ab).21st May pe Nandi Hills se le kar that hot sex (partial-sex for
    me) in the car on 8th Dec to 19th ko tere ghar jaane tak its been
    AWESOMMMMMEEEEEEEE Srivastava. I never thought that being in a relationship
    can be this easy. I mean, jackpot to me, i got a pretty girlfriend and my
    bestfriend in you. <br />Now that u have set the trend of "points" wale

      wonderful and i look forward to spend the rest of my time with you. I love
      you❤️.

    <p>
      I often read Gulzar, and recently i came across a poem of his which had
      these 2 lines which made me realise how much i miss u rn while u are asking me '3 baje tak kya kr rhe the': <br />
      <i>tu itni qareeb hai ki tujhe dekhu toh kaise</i> <br /><i
        >thodi si alag ho toh tere chehre ko dekhu</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      yeh na sirf padhne ke lie achha lagta hai yaar, the moment i say BYE to u
      office se nikalte waqt or ibis and doosre jagah se nikalte waqt i start
      missing u.
    </p>
    <p>
      so yeah, now i think i have successfully bored u by telling about my year.
