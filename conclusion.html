      Toh ab meine yeh bol diya ke y this year has been great (iske bahaane full
      paka diya heheðŸ˜™) and also how muchhhhh i hate u. <br />now i just want to
      add a conclusion to this lonnnnnngggg essayðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. <br />
      When Mohammad Rafi once said- <br /><i
        >aisi to meri taqdeer na thi tumsa jo koi mehboob mile</i
      >
      <br /><i>dil aaj khushi se pagal hai, dil aaj khushi se pagal hai</i>
      <br /><i>ae jaan-e-wafa tum khub mile</i> <br /><i
        >dil kyun na bane paagal, kya tumne adah paayi <br />ye dekh ke dil
        jhooma, li pyaar ne angadayi <br />
        deewana hua baadal</i
      >
      <br />
      he was speaking about me i guess. even i don't think i had the
      "<i>taqdeer</i>" ke tum mujhe mil jao and i am thankful to god for that.
      <br />baby i love u so much that the very thought of us not being together
      at any point of time scares the fuck out of me. when i don't get a reply
      from u i get scared ke did i say something wrong (tu washroom mein rehti
      hai tabhi). when i see akshat or banarjee speaking to u it scares me. i
      feel like bc, aa gye competitors saale. but "hi babyy","i love you more
      Kulkarni" makes everything awesome again. wholesome pack hai yaar tu, mere
      gande jokes pe hasti hai, mere bollywood gaano ke lyrics na aane pe roast
      krti hai, mere saath kuch punjabi gaano pe vibe krti hai and sab se main
      toh mujhe and mere bakchodiyo ko jhelti hai. <br />i miss u all the time
      Srivastava.uk i used to ask my friends jinke break up hue ho ke do u feel
      that void now? few would say yes and few do deny. now, i pity all those
      who denied. and i guess that's because they didn't have what i have got
      with u baby. i think log give up kr dete hai yeh dhoondte dhoondte jo
      mujhe tum mein mila hai. our love is as pure as dirty as we are in the bed
      babyðŸ˜˜ðŸ¤¤. <br />
      it has been a great year with u Srivastava. pata hi nhi chala kaise Daniel
      Craig wale F1 reel se Dec 31st aa gyi. everything with u has been perfect.
      u have made me a better person baby. socha tha bohttt kuch likhunga bc
      lekin abhi full blank ho gya huðŸ˜‚. i am sorry for that one stupid thing
      which i did on 9th of November and made u cry, i am rly sorry for that.
      <br />
      Well, Happy New Year once again. i wish all the success to u, i wish ke tu
      Operations team mein jae, i wish mera bhi kuch achha ho jae. I hope this
      year we go on manyyyyy trips together, WONDERLA bhi jaana hai tumhare
      saath (although u have asked me not to come), cheers to many more nights
      at ibis, let's get more dirty on bed baby heheðŸ˜˜ðŸ¤¤. <br />Also, if u ever
      break up with me then saare anti-south,anti-kannada msgs viral kr dunga
      heheðŸ˜ˆ. <br />Allahmdulillah ðŸ¤²ðŸ¤² <br />
      JAI SHREE RAMðŸš©
      <br />
      <br />While i was at this point of code, jab woh video render ho rha tha
      and css (jo thoda boht hai) woh abhi baaki tha u asked me if i had read ur
      100 points wala msg. I think obviously, like a normal human being u were
      expecting a good sweet reply for that but mein yeh banane mein laga tha
      toh i could not reply. i just hope ke jaldi se bc 31st aa jae and i send u
      this. i don't want u to feel that i am an ignorant boyfriend. And i know u
      have trust issues (mazak kr rha hu but still for my satisfaction) i am
      attaching this <a href="details.png" target="_self">picture</a> which
      shows the date when this folder of code was created).
      <br />
      Now, the last part of my short (ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) "new year wish" to you: (quality shayad utni achhi nhi hai baad mein i'll share)
